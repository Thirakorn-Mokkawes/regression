    "1. **Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The data is divided into $k$ equally sized folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For each fold, the model is trained on $k-1$ folds and tested on the remaining fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This process is repeated $k$ times, with each fold used once as the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After completing all $k$ iterations, the performance metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE, $R^2$) are averaged across the folds to provide a single estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example of 5-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Divide the data into 5 parts: [Fold 1, Fold 2, Fold 3, Fold 4, Fold 5].\n",
    "    - Train on Folds 2–5 and test on Fold 1.\n",
    "    - Train on Folds 1, 3–5 and test on Fold 2.\n",
    "    - Train on Folds 1, 2, 4, 5 and test on Fold 3.\n",
    "    - Train on Folds 1–3, 5 and test on Fold 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Reduces Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cross-validation helps identify overfitting by evaluating model performance on different subsets of data. If the model performs well across all folds, it is likely to generalize better to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provides a Reliable Estimate of Model Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By averaging the results across multiple folds, cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data, compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Utilizes Data Efficiently**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cross-validation makes use of the entire dataset for both training and testing, ensuring that every observation is used for validation exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Helps with Model Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cross-validation is useful for comparing different models or hyperparameter settings, providing a fair basis for selecting the best-performing model."
